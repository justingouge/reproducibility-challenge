# Federated User Verification 

This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Federated Learning of User Verification ModelsWithout Sharing Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08776)   
Only experiments on CelebA is produced by the code.

Note: The scripts will be slow without the implementation of parallel computing. 

## Requirements
python>=3.6  
pytorch>=0.4

## Run

Please only run with python main_uv_alg.py 

To change the code length, message length, and d_min safely, open the options file and change the default values.
